# Defenders of a Small World

My idea for this year is to have a giant planet-eating monster floating around the solar system. The player will either be a small spaceship trying to defend the solar system by killing the monster or the monster fending off tiny spaceships so it can have some planet-sized snacks.

I want to have a somewhat realistic planetary model with semi-authentic gravity which gets messed up by the monster and the disappearing planets. That might be a bit complicated so Iâ€™ll see what that involves first.
